### hw4-asteroid_game
A simple console-based game where the user controls a spaceship which has the abilities to move to the sides and to fire. The objective is to destroy the asteroids in front of the spaceship before they get too close and hit the spaceship. No function definitions were allowed in this homework, so there are a lot of duplicated pieces of code.
